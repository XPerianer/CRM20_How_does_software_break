# CRM20 How does software break ![Sanity Checks](https://github.com/XPerianer/CRM20_How_does_software_break/workflows/Sanity%20Checks/badge.svg)

This repository is to document my work in the SS 2020 Seminar Code Repository Mining.
It contains analysis code, and also documented analysis in the jupyter notebooks.

The mutation testing datasets were generated with [Mutester](https://github.com/XPerianer/CRM2020), a tool I developed to simplify generation of mutation testing data.
